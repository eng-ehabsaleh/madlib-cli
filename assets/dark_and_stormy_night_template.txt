Make Me A Video Game!

I the {Adjective} and {Adjective1} {A_First_Name} have {Past_Tense_Verb}{A_First_Name1}'s {Adjective2} sister and plan to steal her {Adjective3} {Plural_Noun}!

What are a {Large_Animal} and backpacking {Small_Animal} to do? Before you can help {A_Girl_Name}, you'll have to collect the {Adjective4} {Plural_Noun1} and {Adjective5} {Plural_Noun2} that open up the {Number_from_1_to_50} worlds connected to A {First_Name_1} Lair. There are {Number1} {Plural_Noun3} and {Number2} {Plural_Noun4} in the game, along with hundreds of other goodies for you to find.
